                                to be influenced by it. I am sorry that I could not be there from the beginning but it
                                was very important for me to listen to the proceedings. Values are fast fading and I was
                                able to see it in you and thats enough for me to have liked every bit of the day.
                                Congratulations!!! I will be away for 10 days but I will give you a call once I am back.
